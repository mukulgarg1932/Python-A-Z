    "    Abstraction in python is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user.\n",
    "    This is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. That enables the user to implement even more complex\n",
    "    logic on top of the provided abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden background/back-end complexity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     In Python, abstraction can be achieved by having/using abstract classes and methods in our programs.\n",

    "2.Encapsulation --\n",
    "\n",
    "    Encapsulation is one of the cornerstone concepts of OOP. \n",
    "    The basic idea of Encapsulation is to wrap up both data and methods into one single unit.\n",

    "    \n",
    "3.Polymorphism\n",
